This is the README about the socket console (SOCKCON) program that we provided you.
This program is here to help you with the emulation of a serial line.

When started in a Linux terminal, the sockcon program will try continuously to connect
to the emulation, in order to "plug in" the serial line. This connection, through a local
unix socket domain, is the hardware equivalent of wiring the electric lines to the
UART chip on the board.

Once connected, the sockcon behaves as a full-duplex console.

	- Whatever you type is sent through the socket.
	- Whatever is received from the socket is echoed on the screen

So this is a software emulation of a keyboard/screen combo.

 --- ATTENTION --- ATTENTION --- ATTENTION ---   

You must pay attention to the details here, we said
that what is typed is sent, but it is not echoed locally. 
So unless you have an echo on the emulation side, nothing will
appear. 

We provided with a sample that just does that, it is called serial.asm.
You must already have your interrupts working, since it relies on an 
interrupt handler.

The serial.asm is a simple echo program, reading from the serial RX and
echoing everything to the serial TX. With this simple behavior, you have
a console with sockcon, you will see what you type.

Side Note:
  To achieve the sockcon behavior, we had to modify the terminal setting.
  This is interesting to look at the code in the main function of the 
  sockcon program in order to understand what is going on.
   
Have fun.
